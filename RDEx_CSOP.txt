RDEx is built upon CL-SRDE and fully incorporates all strategies from RDEx(SOP).
This includes the use of an elite ranking strategy to strengthen the guidance of the best individuals, thereby shifting the algorithmâ€™s focus more toward exploitation in the later stages of evolution.
To mitigate premature convergence and maintain population diversity, a Cauchy distribution-based dimension-wise random jump mechanism is introduced in the crossover phase, enabling continuous improvement even in highly localized search regions.

After conducting a limited set of parameter tuning experiments, the results demonstrate that RDEx significantly outperforms both the champion and runner-up algorithms from CEC24CSOP in terms of convergence speed and solution accuracy.
