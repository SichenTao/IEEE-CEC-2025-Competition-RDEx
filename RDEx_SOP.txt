RDEx is an improved algorithm based on LSRTDE, designed to enhance convergence and local search capabilities.
While the original algorithm demonstrates outstanding global search ability, its relatively slow convergence speed often results in unsatisfactory solution accuracy.
To address this, RDEx introduces an elite ranking strategy during the later stages of convergence to strengthen the guidance of the best individuals, thus shifting the algorithmâ€™s focus more toward exploitation.

To prevent premature convergence and the rapid loss of population diversity, a Cauchy distribution-based dimension-wise random jump strategy is incorporated during crossover. This ensures that the algorithm can continue to improve even within narrowly defined local search regions.

By preserving the strong exploration ability of the original algorithm and successfully integrating state-of-the-art local search mechanisms, RDEx significantly improves the solution accuracy of advanced differential evolution algorithms on every unsolved instance within the CEC25SOP benchmark set.
