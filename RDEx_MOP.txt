RDEx is built upon the CEC24MOP-winning algorithm TFBCEIBEA, with key modifications including the replacement of its variation operator with the DE/current-to-best/1 strategy and the introduction of a Cauchy distribution-based dimension-wise random jump mechanism in the crossover phase.
By employing a DE operator that is more effective than GA-based methods and combining it with a diversity-preserving mechanism that balances convergence and exploration, RDEx achieves significant improvements in both precision and convergence speed compared to TFBCEIBEA on the CEC25MOP benchmark set.
